#Navigation

One of the three controls subteams, the navigation team focuses mostly on integrating sensor data, interfacing ROS architecture and lower level boards and path planning.  Work is also done on various calibration and tesing tools, including a 2d simulation GUI currently in development.

If you wish to join this team or have any questions please email the Controls lead Seamus Johnston at sbjohnst@uwaterloo.ca.
