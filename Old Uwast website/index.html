			<h2 id="aboutUs">Who are we?</h2>
		</div>
		<p>We are a team of students from the University of Waterloo, renowned as one of the top engineering schools in Canada, whose goal is to win the 2017 International Robotic Sailing Regatta. Our team consists of a variety of engineers including Mechatronics, Mechanical, Electrical, and Chemical engineers. Besides sailing, we are passionate about complex electronics, robotics systems, and mechanical design. As a team we are working together to build something truly innovative. As a student team we rely on sponsor help to work.</p>

			<h2 id="competition">Competition</h2>
		</div>
		<p>The International Robotic Sailing Regatta (IRSR) is a student design competition where teams build mostly autonomous robotic sailboats varying in size from 1m - 4m to compete against one another.  The boats compete in challenges that promote the development of intelligent vision and obstacle recognition algorithms, as well as developing the future of shipping.  Challenges include transporting bricks autonomously, finding and hitting marks, and a fully autonomous 10 km race.  The competition is geared for the development of robotic sailing, autonomous vehicles, and clean energy developments for the future of the shipping industry.</p>
